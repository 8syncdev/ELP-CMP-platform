CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION
Reason for the topic
In the modern era of digital transformation, web-based platforms have revolutionized the way educational institutions manage and deliver their services. A Course Management and Code Evaluation Website represents a sophisticated solution to the challenges of traditional education systems, particularly in programming courses. This platform not only centralizes course management but also streamlines the process of assessing coding assignments, significantly enhancing both efficiency and accuracy.
The proposed website serves dual purposes: facilitating course administration and automating code evaluation. Course management features include organizing syllabi, assignments, and grading, ensuring instructors can effectively oversee multiple classes. On the other hand, the automated code evaluation module provides a robust mechanism for grading programming exercises by running submitted code against predefined test cases. This reduces the manual workload for educators and offers instant, objective feedback to students.
